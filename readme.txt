ListingPress automatically embeds real estate listings on to a wordpress blog.

== Description ==

ListingPress creates a Wordpress-esque query system for a registered real estate agent in the United States to automatically embed listings in to their Wordpress blog. The plugin is free and open source (released GPL) but unfortunately the listing data is not. For more information on this, please visit ListingPress.com. To install this plugin we recommend creating two more templates; listings.php and listing.php.  The ListingPress loop is almost identical to the Wordpress loop.  We have used the same vernacular and structure as Wordpress does, so that even the casual Wordpress developer will be able to easily implement ListingPress on a real estate agent's blog.  We use Wordpress' pretty permalink structure, so to display listings from San Diego, CA, the url would simply be http://domain.com/San Diego/CA.  Furthermore, search forms are very easy to create.  The action would simply be the index file similar to Wordpress and to see every query variable available please visit listingpress.com.  We also make embedding google maps in to Wordpress blogs as easy as a function call (ie. the_google_map()).  ListingPress will also be releasing templates to better illustrate how easy it is to incorporate listings in to any Wordpress blog.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire directory 'ListingPress' to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory so it should look like this -> /wp-content/plugins/ListingPress
2. Ensure that a cache folder exists and is writable by the server -> /wp-content/plugins/ListingPress/cache
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress Administration.
4. Enter your registration code under the ListingPress Settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need a registration code? =

The way listings work in the United States is like this: Similar to stocks, only Real Estate Brokers can buy and sell real estate. Real estate agents are similar to sales agents for their brokers. Every agent has to "hang" their license with a broker. These many brokers across the country get together regionally and form what are called associations. These associations, which again are made up of several large brokers and many little brokers, sign a broker reciprocity agreement. You can advertise my listings as long as I can advertise yours. The associations than hire an outside company to manage the listing data. This outside company creates private web applications that allow real estate agents to upload listings to a central database and search the listings for their clients. For many years, this was the only way anyone could see all the available listings.  And again, this isn't actually ALL of the listings. For instance, if you wanted to sell your home by yourself, (referred to as a FSBO, or for sale by owner), that would not get listed in the associations database. But recently there has been a movement to standardize the industry, referred to as RETS (real estate transaction standard). This standardization is requiring these private companies to provide a uniform way of accessing the data. Then vendors (such as ListingPress) can come in and access that data and provide public facing web applications to display this data. There are fees at every step, as well as a ton of legalities on exactly how you can display this listing data on your website. Therefore, every agent using ListingPress, actually needs to be registered with their specific association so that they may monitor how the listing data is display on their site.  While we are actively pushing the envelope on how agents can advertise listings, at this point, it is not a free service and to use this plugin you must be a registered real estate agent. On the positive side, there are a lot of opportunities for developers to make money setting up Wordpress blogs with ListingPress for a real estate agent.
